ID: GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56
Aliases: CVE-2024-35195
Details: When making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool.

### Remediation
Any of these options can be used to remediate the current issue, we highly recommend upgrading as the preferred mitigation.

* Upgrade to `requests>=2.32.0`.
* For `requests<2.32.0`, avoid setting `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session.
* For `requests<2.32.0`, call `close()` on `Session` objects to clear existing connections if `verify=False` is used.
